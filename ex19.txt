-- importing the modules to retrieve enrez id, blast result and to read NCBI Blast result.

-- searching for Id's of LIME gene in Homosapiens species in protein database.

-- now sending these id one by one to run the blast by NCBIWWW.qblast. First checking that the blast result file is already existed on local machine or not.

-- blastp (because) we are running protein query and want protein seq, database is refseq_protein.

-- storing the blast result in xml and storing on our local device.

-- Now parsing the xml file and looking for only those results which belong to 'Mus musculas' organism and having e-value<1e-5

-- printing the title and e-value of for the matched entry
