# tandem repeat in integer number

-- importing sys module and using command line argument.

import sys
seq= sys.argv[1]

-- counting the length of sequence

l=len(seq)

-- storing the first nucleotide of input sequence into first_nuc variable.

first_nuc=seq[0]

-- Now I am dividing the total length of sequence by the total number of first nucleotide
-- if the remainder is 0 then DNA sequence consists integer number of perfect tandem repeats.
 
print "DNA sequence consists of an integer number of perfect tandem repeats : ",l%(seq.count(first_nuc))==0
